### 1\. Initial Onboarding & Goal Setting

Upon first interaction, Gym AI will conduct a quick, guided onboarding process to understand your unique profile:

  * **Personal Information:** You'll provide basic details like age, gender, height, current weight, and body composition goals (e.g., lose 10 kg, gain muscle, improve endurance).
  * **Dietary Preferences & Restrictions:** Specify your preferred diet (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, keto, balanced), allergies (e.g., nuts, dairy), and any foods you dislike.
  * **Fitness Level & Experience:** Indicate your current activity level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and how often you currently exercise.
  * **Available Equipment:** Let the AI know if you have access to a full gym, limited home equipment, or prefer bodyweight exercises.
  * **Scheduling Preferences:** Set your preferred times for workouts and meal reminders to align with your daily routine.

Based on this information, Gym AI will generate your initial, personalized **Training Program** and **Diet Chart**.

  * **Workout Notifications:** You'll be notified when it's time for your scheduled workout. The notification could include a link to the day's exercises, complete with demonstration videos or detailed instructions for proper form.
  * **Post-Workout Check-in:** After your workout, Gym AI will prompt you to log your session. You can confirm completion, rate your effort, and report any difficulties or achievements (e.g., "I lifted heavier today\!", "My legs are sore").

### 3\. Feedback, Progress Tracking & Adaptation

Your feedback is crucial for Gym AI to continually optimize your plans:

  * **Logging Meals:** You can quickly confirm that you've eaten your meals or indicate if you swapped something (e.g., "Ate breakfast," "Swapped chicken for tofu at lunch").

      * If you're struggling, it might reduce intensity or suggest alternative exercises.
      * Based on your weight changes and energy levels, the AI will dynamically adjust your diet plan (e.g., modifying calorie intake or macronutrient ratios).
  * **Q\&A and Advice:** You can ask Gym AI questions directly, such as "What's a good pre-workout snack?", "How can I reduce knee pain during squats?", or "Is this food healthy?" â€“ receiving instant, data-driven advice.
